# Cyber Spider

Cyber Spider is an algorithm heavy project that simulates crawling through telemetry log data from government computers in order to predict future cyberattacks. The thing that makes this project so interesting is the size of the input; we are given trillions of lines of log data, so any ordinary implementation wouldn't do. Below, the technology and implementation details are covered. The spec for the project can be viewed [here][./Cyber Spider Spec.pdf].

## Technologies

This project is written in pure C++. The files are split up as they typically are; headers and source.

## Implementation
